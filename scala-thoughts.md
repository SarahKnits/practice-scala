# Thoughts about Scala
###What's easy to do in Scala? What's not?

Our initial impression of Scala was that it was very similar to Java in syntax and many of the functions. After completing some of the exercises, we found that it was quite different. Pattern matching in particular tripped us up initially, but after finding guards we found it much easier. We also found None to be more intuitive than null, and thought this was easier to use. 

Iteration was a bit more difficult in Scala, and many of the advanced features were difficult to find. We were pretty confused by Some, None, and Option. We feel we understand these a bit better, but they were not intuitive to start. 

Scala makes working with anonymous functions very easy. There are a lot of built in functions that made solving problems easier. 

###What is/are your favorite language design choice(s) that the designers of Scala made? Why?

One of our favorite design choices was not requiring everything to be in classes. This was more similar to Python than Java, and was something we appreciated. 

###What is/are your least favorite language design choice(s)? Why? And why do you think the designers made that / those choice(s)?

Although it may seem more intuitive, I (Sarah) was not a fan of the lack of semicolon necessity. I (Hayden), being more of a C-style programmer, would prefer to do functional programming with functions that mostly iterate over a set rather than using recursion. Although these are possible in Scala, it seems that Scala prefers for us to use recursion. 

###What Scala features would you like to learn more about?

We are still a bit confused about implicit variables, fuctions, and classes. We want to learn more about how to use these properly. We are also starting to enjoy using pattern matching, and want to continue learning about these, as well as traits.

Also, as we're starting to learn Haskell in PLs. We'd like to look at the differences and similarities with Haskell and Scala.
